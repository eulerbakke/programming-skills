The solution runs a for loop checking if any of the conditions are true in order to define the output: 

1. Number is multiple of 15 (using the % operator)? This means that the number is multiple of 3 and 5 simultaneously. Print "FooBaa"
2. If not, the code checks if the number is multiple of 3 or 5 (also using the % operator). Printing "Foo" or "Baa"
3. And if the previous conditions are not true, the number is printed.
