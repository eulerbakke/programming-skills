The solution used for this question was using UNION.

Basically, two SELECT queries (one from Dogs table and another from Cats table) with UNION between them gave the expected solution.

Example: 

-- Table Dogs --
ID  Name
1   Zac
2   Little
3   Catt

-- Table Cats --
ID  Name
1   Catt
2   Meow
3   Zac
4   Catt

-- SQL Query Result: --
Name
Catt
Little
Meow
Zac
