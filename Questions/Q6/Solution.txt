The answer is Polymorphism.

Comments: 

Basically, the polymorphism happens when two or more classes derived from a superclass respond in different ways, by applying the method overriding concept.
An object of a superclass can behave as an object from its subclasses, responding according to its specific characteristics.
The pillars of the polymorphism are class inheritance and methods overriding.
